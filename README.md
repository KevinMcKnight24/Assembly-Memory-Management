A memory management program written in assembly for the HCS12C family of microprocessors. This program is a data management and monitor program you are able to view what data is in memory using the show and MD commands and you are able to save new data using the write and LD commands. You can load or view one byte at a time or many bytes at once depending on which command is used. The LD and MD will load many at once and the show and write command will only load one.
